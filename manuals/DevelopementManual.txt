3. Programming rules

Classes should start with a upper case letter.

Variable and function names should start with lower case letters. If the name is made of more than one word they should be written with out spaces and each word starting with a upper case letter, excluding the first word of course. 

Curly braces should always have their own lines.

To sum up:

public class ExampleClass
{
	private int numberOfThings;

	public void setNumberOfThings(int number)
	{
		this.numberOfThings = number;
	}
}


Before commiting any changes to github run:
bin/ccunittest
It will check for errors, code coverage and coding rules.
